This webscrapping project has a two-fold goal:
1. To scrape the US daily streaming data from the Spotify Charts website
2. To explore characteristics present in Spotify music consumption as well as in music releases from the artists

Data:
Data was scrapped from Spotify Charts (https://spotifycharts.com/regional/us/daily/latest) using Scrapy. Only the US Daily streaming data from 01/01/2017 to 10/30/2020 was scraped. The features scraped are:
- song_title
- artist
- date
- movement ('rect' for no movement, 'polygon' for upward or downward movement, 'circle' for new entry)
- ranking
- streams
